                <p>Alyssum plants are an excellent plant for absolutely any garden. They typically grow 3 to 6 inches
                    tall and are ideal for flower beds and walkways. They require very little care and can grow back
                    every year if they're cared for just a little. They need well-drained loamy soil and are fairly
                    tolerant. Though they're a self sow plant, their weakness is frost. Consider your climate before
                    planting them and deciding whether or not this flower is for you.</p>

                <p>If indoors or in a steady climate, the anthurium plant can bloom all year. If you're new to plant
                    care, the anthurium plant may not be for you though. They're a bit tricky to care for and can be
                    difficult to get to bloom. The lighting you pick for your anthurium plants is very important. With
                    too little or too much sun, they can begin to turn brown or stop blooming. If you're inexperienced
                    in caring for flower, but really want an anthurium plant, choose a potted variety. Potted anthurium
                    plants can be easily moved so that you can test and choose the best area for it to grow.</p>

                <p>Not surprising due to its name, this flower attracts pollinators like bees, butterflies,
                    hummingbirds, and other birds. Bee balm plants need very good circulation. They're best planted on
                    the outskirts of your garden, mainly because of the creatures they attract. They're very good for
                    the life and longevity of your garden, but best planted far away from busy entryways where someone
                    could be stung.</p>

                <p>It's not surprising that the California poppy plant needs full sun, it's name would imply it. This
                    cutely shaped flower looks like a soft cup and has vivid color. It attracts both butterflies and
                    hummingbirds to help pollinate your garden. It's also tolerant of deer, rabbits, dry soil, and
                    seasons of drought. For all of these reasons it continues to be a favorite plant for gardeners.</p>

                <p>It doesn't take a gardener to recognize a beautiful calla lily plant. This beautiful flower is
                    frequently featured in high-end flower bouquets and business flower arrangements. It has a very
                    unique slender bell shape that curves inwards on itself. Though usually desired in white, they come
                    in various different bright colors like pink, and even dark purple hues that look almost black. They
                    typically grow 10 to 16 inches in height with a sturdy and structured shape.</p>

                <p>There are many types of flowers very similar to the bellflower. There are bellbells, dwarf
                    bellflowers, carpathian harebells, and American bellflowers. The giant bellflower has it's name
                    because it's one of the larger varieties. Campanula, or the bellflower family, has over 300
                    different species with both perennials, biannual, and annual breeds. This cute and typically dark
                    colored flower grows to its fullest beauty in June. In some areas it will continue to bloom into the
                    Fall months as well. Though there are many colors to choose from before planting, the dark purple or
                    "bluebell hue" blue, are the most popular.</p>

                <p>From the Brassicaceae family, this plant grows up to 12 inches high and can span an impressive 24
                    inches wide. It's very important not to overwater candytuft plants as their sensitive to their soil.
                    It's better to air on the side of overly dry than overly moist. Candytuft plants have a larger
                    flower head which attracts insects of all kinds. Perfect for attracting pollinators, plant them in

                <p>The canna lily plant is not to be confused with the asiatic lily. Though similar in name, the canna
                    lily flower looks very different. Small but richly colored flowers meet together in a stock like
                    formation creating a fragrant and densely colored top. They come in many colors like red, orange,
                    yellow, pink and white. It's important to space canna lily plants appropriately, but the amount of
                    space will depend on the type of canna lilies that you plant. Be sure to check your plant varieties
                    recommended space and number of rhizomes recommended before you begin planting.</p>

                <p>Cardinal flower plants are often also listed as zones 1 - 10 and sometimes 2 - 10. Though they are
                    usually listed as needing full to partial sun, they thrive best in partial sun and shade. A full
                    grown cardinal plant can be anywhere from 30 to 36 inches tall and 10 to 18 inches wide. Gardeners
                    like cardinal flowers because they offer a lot for what you plant and produce many flowers. They
                    produce vibrantly rich red flowers and lance shaped leaves. They attract the good with the bad from
                    butterflies, hummingbirds, and deer. With that said, they are considered poisonous if ingested.</p>

                    cut and dyed different hues with the right dye and techniques. For all these reasons they continue
                    to be one of the most well-known flowers in the world.</p>

                <p>The celosia plant produces such a uniquely shaped and textured flower. In a pointed, bulky shape,
                    this flower packs a punch full of color and adds a interesting look to any garden. The amount of
                    moisture will depend a lot on where they are planted. A partially shaded moist area needs excellent
                    drainage. If you plant celosia in a more sun area it may need more moisture. They're sometimes
                    called "fire grass" because of their exotic colors and how close they grow to the ground.</p>

                <p>Chrysanthemum flowers are also sometimes called death flowers. Just like the dahlia, this flower is
                    commonly used for viewing and funeral flower arrangements. It's a beautiful flower, though it has a
                    less than desirable fragrance. There are many types of chrysanthemum plants. Some popular and
                    well-known types are anemone, pompom(much smaller), regular incurve, single, and spider(with
                    spike-like petals).</p>

                    14 inches tall and are great for cutting as table or bouquet flowers. They attract butterflies and
                    bees and are easy to grow.</p>

                <p>This long lasting clematis plant can last from spring to winter if cared for properly. It blooms in
                    blue, purple, red, white, pink and yellow. Low maintenance and versatile, it celmatis plants grow
                    well in containers, outside, and even around terraces and garden furniture. They have a lovely
                    fragrance and attract birds. The trick to growing clematis plants is a full sun/partial shade
                    balance. Plant them so that the flowers get full sun, and cover their roots using other plants, to
                    help keep them partially shaded.</p>

                <p>Sometimes called prairie clover, some gardeners want it, and some try to get rid of it. Purple
                    prairie
                    clover is medicinal for us and for animals. It grows with little to no care which is partly why

                    garden,
                    but don't let it grow however it pleases. They bloom in later summer and fall and form little flower
                    balls at the top of their stem. With both male and female parts they flourish easily and quickly
                    with full sun.</p>

                <p>A slightly tricky plant, cockscomb will grow taller when planted in full sun, however it should last
                    longer when grown in partial shade. Sometimes called "that funny twisting plant" it does indeed have
                    a strange shape and texture. This plant grows better outdoors than indoors. Once inside it can
                    become too dry and these flowers need moisture to flourish. Ruffled, twisted and curly, these
                    flowers are a unique asset to any garden adding new texture and shape variety.</p>

                <p>Keep in mind when planting columbines, they enjoy full sun, but not heat. If your geographic location
                    is very hot then definitely considered a half full and partial sun location for your columbine
                    plant. The columbine flower has a fun shape that look almost like two separate flowers. The lower
                    petals fold downwards and are usually a darker color. The inner petals curve upwards and are a
                    lighter color. This cute and colorful flower attracts hummingbirds especially. You may also find

                    fall. A great plant for the lazy gardener, they don't need fertilizer and wildlife doesn't bother
                    them. Just water them regularly and enjoy. Vividly colored, long-lasting, and easy to care for,
                    these perennials plants are a great choice for a beginning gardener. Though they look somewhat
                    similar to a daisy or gerbera flower, you can always spot echinacea from it's downward pointing
                    petals and large ball shaped head.</p>

                <p>Called coral bells because of their obvious bell shape, these cute flowers have a unique color and
                    look that's all their own. The blue coral bells are some of the most sought after, but there are
                    also brown, green, purple and red varieties to choose from. Coralbells are a perennial plant that
                    can add an interesting twist to your garden. Their unique shape is a surprise for anyone taking a
                    walk around your garden. You may enjoy planting a few different color varieties together too.</p>

                <p>You'll find not only birds, bees, and butterflies around coreopsis plants, but goldfinches in

                <p>An ideal low maintenance plant, cosmos plants are a self-sow variety that require little care. They
                    attract pollinators like bees, butterfly and bird wildlife, and are annual plants. Though they have
                    a somewhat standard and basic shape, they're packed full of color and mix well with other plants.
                    They're native to the south in the US and Mexico too. Pick from yellow, white, pink, hot pink,
                    orange, red and more colors. Though they need well draining soils, they do need a little bit of
                    moisture too.</p>

                <p>Cranesbill plants require minimal fertilizer and attract few insects. Though they need moist soil,
                    they also need rich soil with nutrients to thrive. This vast and somewhat peculiar plant can grow
                    anywhere from a short 6 inches tall to an impressive 3 feet high. You'll probably hear them more
                    frequently by the name "geranium" than any other. It produces a cute and usually softly colored
                    flower in white, lavender, pink and a pale blue. They'll last until the first frost. If you're able
                    to bring them indoors occasionally, you may be able to get them to last longer.</p>

                <p>The crocosmai plant needs plenty of sun, but it also needs protection. Make sure wherever you plant
                    your crocosmia flowers that they are sheltered from wind which will dry them out. This pretty and
                    unusual flower has curled, round, and spiky petals. It's important to plant them only after you
                    believe frost is finished for the season. Crocosmias require the usual flower care and pruning. When
                    you see that a flower is dead or fallen, remove it from the flowerhead or bed to encourage new
                    growth. Though slightly messy to work with and care for, they offer a vivid pop of color to your

                <p>From the iris family, crocus flowers have a similar color but a different shape. It's well known in
                    the Mediterranean and specifically to the island of Crete. The crocus is a unique flower in that it
                    fully blooms very close to the ground in many varieties. When they grow they form clumps of very
                    vividly colorful flowers. They're are early to bloom at the beginning of spring. Choose from white,
                    yellow, pale pink, lavender and even stripe varieites for your garden. Different kinds of crocuses
                    will grow to different heights, but almost none grow any higher than a faint 6 inches.</p>

                <p>If you've never seen a crown imperial plant, you may be taken aback by their structure at first.
                    Tall, very stiff, and literally with what looks like a crown of flowers, this plant has a unique
                    design that's all its own. It has what looks like tufts of grass on top of its head, and a circular
                    row of hanging bell shaped flowers below. It's deer resistant and attracts pollinators too. The
                    crown imperial plant grows up to 3 feet tall and its flowers are gloriously huge.</p>

                <p>You may be thinking it attracts a bird, but the cuckoo flower is named for it's blooming season. It's
                    easily recognized and distinct 4 petal formation, blooms at the same time as the first sightings of
                    the cuckoos in the British Isles. That's why it was cutely nicknamed the cuckoo flower. It's a plain
                    and simple bloom that attracts butterflies. They're said to be edible under the right conditions and
                    tests, and are used in some areas as a garnish in porridge and yogurt dishes.</p>

                <p>The cyclamen is well known as a Mediterranean plant, but it can grow in many geographic locations. A
                    slightly fussy plant, it prefers cooler temperatures between 40 - 60 degrees F. Watering cyclamen
                    plants is also a bit tricky. They need moistened, then well-drained soil. Be sure to remove excess
                    water using a dish of other system. In between waterings you'll want to let it dry out slightly. Due
                    to its sensitive nature, it's a plant that should be reserved for seasoned gardeners(or very
                    dedicated beginners) who can meet its constant needs.</p>

                <p>Famous for their unique structure and romantic look, daffodils have long been one of our favorite
                    flowers to give to one another. This sweet plant has a shape that has long stolen the hearts of
                    onlookers. Bright yellow with larger exterior petals and a cup shaped center, it's easy to recognize
                    the daffodil flower. Daffodil plants are fairly easy to care for and can live longer than people!
                    They come in white, red, pink, orange, and green, but yellow it the traditional and most known hue.
                    There are 13 different types of daffodils, and they all look a little bit different. You may find
                    that one breed of daffodil will grow better in your geographic location than another.</p>

                <p>The dahlia plant is considered both a perennial and annual flower, depending on where it's planted
                    and how it's cared for. Dahlia plants can live at least three years and are sensitive to cold
                    weather. If you plant them in zones 8+ they can usually survive the conditions. If you plant them in
                    zones 7 and lower, then you need to be able to move and transport them away from the cooler
                    temperatures. The dahlia flower has a very distinct shape with both curved and pointed petals.
                    Dahlias are associated with a variety of meanings from elegance, dignity, death and warnings. This
                    is due to its frequent use in old story telling, TV shows and popular movies.</p>

                <p>Daphne plants grow from 3 to 4 feet high and grow slowly. It's a shrub plant that will have an
                    abundance of flowers when it's in full bloom. You can cut and prune them, but it's important to cut
                    stems at an angle and at the right time. The nice thing about growing daphne plants is that that
                    don't have to be pruned unless you want to cut sections from them. As long as their soil is cared
                    for, they should bloom fully and last awhile.</p>

                <p>Daylilies are usually a bright orange and have trumpet shaped petals. They behave differently in that
                    they open in the morning(hence the name day lily), and then they wither in the evening. Often it
                    will reproduce another flower immediately the next day. They require very little care and are
                    resistant to heat, drought, and even rabbits. It's best to plant daylily plants in early fall or
                    early spring to give them time to mature properly.</p>

                <p>Delphiniums can be both biennials or perennials. There are over 300 species of delphinium plants so
                    it depends on what type you choose to grow. Many people grow delphinium plants outdoors, but they
                    also come in potted varieties that are popular. Florists love delphiniums for creating flower
                    arrangements and bouquets. They're easily cut and they'll even bloom again once cut. They attract
                    hummingbirds and butterflies and also tolerate deer. Choose from the ever famous rich blue hue, or
                    white, pink, purple and more. Since there are over 300 types of delphinium, there's really no limit
                    to the color you'd like for your garden. </p>

                <p>The desert rose fits its name appropriately. Looking a bit like a rose and found in desert
                    environments, the desert rose is beautiful and surprising. The petals are soft, fluffy, and slightly
                    curled. You can also bring your desert rose plant indoors. Keep it in a temperature of 70 - 80
                    degrees F, and don't let it live in the area that drops below 60. </p>

                <p>Known as the Tasmania flower, dianella plants are known for growing in Australia, though now they
                    are grown in many areas. You may miss a dianella plant at first, mistaking it for long, bladed green
                    green, until you spot it's petite and delicate flowers. Dianella flowers need plenty of sun and are
                    easy to grow. They're from the lily family and usually have two varying colors. They also come in
                    striped varieties, though they're more rare. They attract birds, insects, and are usually left alone
                    by deer. When carrying for dianellas, simply remove any dead debris or fallen flowers as you would
                    with most plants.</p>

                <p>Dianthus plants can behave as perennials, annuals, and biennials. You can spot a dianthus flower not
                    just by it's bloom, but by its bluish-grey foliage too. A great garden addition, they can grow in
                    regular soil, around rocks, and in hilly landscapes. They're deer resistant, but rabbits like them.
                    They need full sun and can grow in hot conditions as long as they're planted at the right time.
                    They're also a low maintenance plant that only needs weekly watering.</p>

                <p>The dietes flower plant comes from the iris family and likes Loamy, moist, and well-drained soil.
                    What soil you need to use will vary by where you plant them and your geographic location too. Dietes
                    plants are worth caring for, their flower is stunning, unusual, and has a petal shape that's easy to
                    immediately recognize. They're also nicknamed the fortnight lily because they bloom vividly in two
                    week intervals. These impressive flowers span an easy 3 inches wide with multi-colored patterned
                    petals. While a dietes plant prefers full sun, if you live in hotter climates, it will welcome a
                    small amount of afternoon shade.</p>

                <p>Echinacea plants can grow from 2 - 4 feet high depending on the type that you plant. Be sure that
                    wherever you plant them they'll still receive full sunlight while in full bloom. Echinacea is
                    derived from the Latin term echinus, meaning hedgehog. Be prepared to wait for your echinacea plant
                    to grow, they can take up to 2 - 3 years before you'll see anything. Echinacea, or coneflowers as
                    some like to call them, can also be grown in a pot if your prefer.</p>

                <p>Echium plants are pretty, but do require some space in the garden. They grow 3 to 6 feet high and can
                    cover a surface area anywhere from 2 - 3 feet wide. They're from the Boraginaceae family and are
                    commonly nicknamed tower of jewels due to their height and structure. The very petite flowers that
                    bloom at the top from a stalk like formation. Some viewers refer to them a flower corn because once

                    often find them in woodland areas because they're able to thrive under heavy tree cover. Also deer
                    resistant, wildlife won't heed them much in their growth process. Sometimes you can smell a small

                <p>This flower at first glance can look a little like a rose, until upon closer look you can see that
                    it's less full and the tips of th petals turn out and downwards. It attracts bees, butterflies, and
                    birds. Though it blooms in spring, it can last into mid fall in some areas. Similar even in color to
                    roses, you can find it in light and hot pink, dark violet, lavender and different shades of white.
                    Space them 4 - 8 inches apart to ensure that they have space to flourish. </p>

                <p>This low maintenance plant grows 6 - 12 inches high and 8 - 24 inches across. Popular flower colors
                    choices are white and pink, though you may find yellows too. It's also called oenothera, or
                    greencourt lemon. Though their petals appear almost translucent in clear light, they're a
                    surprisingly stout flower and plant. Tolerating heat and drought, they require little care and
                    flourish as long as they maintain wet, moist soil.</p>

                <p>Popular types of everlasting daisies are bright bikini, monstrosum, sundaze, and tom thumb mix; and
                    they're all a little different. Everlasting daisies look similar to a traditional daisy when they
                    first begin to bloom, but once in full bloom they look more similar to carnations. This perennial
                    flower is short lived, but it does return for 2 - 3 years. Since there are quite a few different
                    types, the height of your plant can be between 2 -3 feet tall, and 6 - 18 inches wide. They're
                    native to Australia and come in yellow, orange, red, white and pink. They add beautiful color to any
                    garden, and can be used to create rainbow colored bouquets too.</p>

                <p>More easily called the fire on the mountain plant, or wild poinsettia, this tropical red and orange
                    tipped plant has vivid green leaves and can grow up to 3 feet tall. Though a tropical plant, it's
                    now found in South America, Asia and Australia. It's deer and rabbit resistant because of its stem
                    which has a irritant sap. If working with a euphorbia plant, be sure to wash your hands carefully
                    after pruning, and do not scratch your eyes. While you won't be poisoned or sick, you won't be
                    comfortable either. This is <b>not</b> a plant we recommend growing if you have pets.</p>

                    and easily distinguished from each other by texture and size. Flannel plants are commonly used by
                    gardeners for hedge decorating. They're deer resistant and attract bees to help pollinate your

                    they also attract ladybugs which you should welcome into your garden. Flax flowers are a lovely

                <p>An annual flower, floss flower plants require excellent air circulation and sun. If grown in very hot
                    areas, they can tolerate partial shade too. Their season can greatly differ depending on the cooler
                    temperatures in your area. They'll last until frost in either fall or early winter depending on your
                    location and whether or not they're potted. These fluffy flowers may not be the prettiest floral
                    selection but florist use them more for their texture and pastel hue than for the flower's physical
                    structure.</p>

                <p>The shrub forsythia plant looks more like a tree. It's a low maintenance plant that grows to an
                    impressive 3 - 8, or 8 - 20 feet high. As wide as 4 - 12 feet it's often used for home privacy
                    planting, to fill large spaces, or to create walkways. Its bright yellow flower is petite,
                    plentiful, and eye-catching. Perhaps the most surprising thing about forsythia plants isn't their
                    towering scale, but their lovely fragrance. If you choose to plant them right next to your house for
                    privacy, make sure you love the fragrance.</p>

                <p>Available in white, purple, lavender, yellow, pink, and red foxgloves can be planted to create many
                    different affects in your garden. Also called digitalis purpurea, they grow tall and in tube like
                    formations. They can be cut and brought indoors, but cutting them often hurts their chances or
                    continuing to grow. Foxglove plants can be biennials and short lived perennials. Foxglove flowers
                    can be sensitive and slightly difficult to grow. Sometimes they grow fully and don't bloom any
                    flowers at all, even when healthy. No deadheading of your flowers should happen until the plant has
                    fully taken seed, otherwise the flowers won't bloom and take seed again. Gardeners continue to love
                    foxgloves, even with their difficult in growing, and now there are new foxglove hybrids to choose
                    from. </p>

                <p>This beautiful plant grows into a 15 to 25 foot tall tree, full of beautiful flowers. Many people
                    associate the plumeria tree with Hawaii where locals wear them often and you can find wild plumeria
                    tress growing along the landscape. The frangipani tree's leaves grow typically 1 foot long in a dark
                    green. When the wood is opened you'll find a white sap into of its bark. Frangipani plants need
                    fertilizer usually twice a year and can be pruned too. These trees do attract caterpillars, so you
                    should occasionally put your gardening gloves on and try to remove them.</p>

                <p>Growing 2 - 3 feet tall, these gorgeous plants are well known even by non-gardeners. Native to
                    southern China and Japan, their simplicity and clean design is loved around the world. They also
                    carry a lovely fragrance that perfumers have long used in their creations. They are wonderful as cut
                    flowers and florists love to put them in flower bouquets. They are deer tolerant and need loamy,
                    moist and well-drained soil. You may have to play with your plant's surroundings in order to get the
                    best soil mix for your location.</p>

                <p>Geraniums are sensitive to cold, so many times when you see them in a garden, you'll see them in pots
                    or other containers. They can bloom from spring into winter if they're brought indoors before it's
                    too cold. They bloom fully in summer and can grow to be 12 to 18 inches tall. Geraniums are
                    considered dangerous for cats and dogs in particular. If you have pets at home than a geranium plant
                    is probably not for you. If you really do want to have geranium plants indoors, be sure to keep them
                    somewhere where you know with certainty your pet can not get to it. We would recommend if you have
                    pets, not to grow them.</p>

                <p>The gerbera, also frequently called the big gerbera daisy, is a colorful and large flower. It does
                    look very similar to a daisy, except for it's oversized appearance and it's wider center. Gerbera
                    plants also have more petals than a daisy. Another favorite of florists, they're pretty simple to
                    grow and inexpensive. They're often used in birthday bouquets to fit a celebration theme. </p>

                <p>These 3 foot tall plants are a favorite for florists and gardeners. They are beautiful, and without
                    taking up a lot of space in a bouquet, they can add many flowers and colors. That's because their
                    flowers grow one on top of the other when in full bloom. Gladiolas come in many colors such as pink,
                    white, yellow, pale purple, dark purple, hot pink, green and more. It's easy to find one to suit
                    almost any space in your garden so long as you plan for the height needed to grow it. When picking
                    your gladiolus plant, try to pick larger corms. The larger the corms, the larger your plant and its
                    flowers should be. Gladiolus plants are cheap to buy and easy to care for. You can also keep cutting
                    them to have flowers for your kitchen or living room table.</p>

                <p>Goldenrod plants are from the aster family and there are over 120 known species. Many people consider
                    them almost a weed because of their quick ability to grow and rapidly cover land. They aren't
                    deterred by many environments and can grow in wet marshy, hilly, rocky, forest and meadow areas.
                    Growing 2 to 6 feet high with a brilliant yellow hue, they're easy to spot and are frequently found
                    in North and South America. These deer resistant plants also have few diseases and insects problems,
                    though some people are
                    allergic to them.</p>

                    also not overly soil sensitive. This means that they can grow in both well-drained and moist soil in
                    most areas. Used frequently in bouquets, they're known as the floral companion to romantic rose
                    bouquets for Valentine's Day, and sweet Mother's Day pink rose bouquets too.</p>

                <p>There are a vast array of different heather plants that can grow in different climates and geographic
                    locations. Because of its vast family, you'll need to look into the specific kind of heather that
                    you want to plant, and what that plant needs. Some heather plants grow well in zones 4 - 8 while
                    others need zones 5 - 9, and some 3 - 7. This plant typically needs a half day of sun and can grow

                    in a dark, rich hue. Though they're traditionally labeled as well-drained soil flowers, they do need

                    if cared for properly. They're useful to gardeners not just for their beauty, but because they're
                    tree tolerant too. If your garden is smaller due to it's proximity to trees, the hollyhock plant can

                <p>Honeysuckle plants are known for their sweetness and unique shape. In America they typically have a
                    lighter color like a yellow or soft white. In Japan though, honeysuckle plants grow in vivid pinks
                    and reds. They are an easily thriving plant, so be sure to somewhat seclude them if you add them to
                    your garden. You can't miss a honeysuckle flower because it's fragrance is sweetly overwhelming. You
                    won't have to smell the flowers, their fragrance will simply permiate the air.</p>

                <p>Plant hyacinth flowering plants in mid to late fall, whenever you think the last frost is over. It's
                    recommended that you grow them where they'll receive full sunlight, but they can usually grow in
                    partial sun as well. They're great for cutting and can be grown outdoors and indoors. When
                    purchasing bulbs, try to pick larger ones which will produce larger flowers. There are many
                    different colors to choose from, but popular choices are the blue-purple, creamy white, and pink
                    flowers.</p>

                <p>Even non-flower lovers can usually spot a hydrangea plant. This very popular flower grows in a few
                    different colors, but blue is very popular. The plant grows straight up with a head that has a round
                    ball shape with many petite clustered flowers. It has a nice fragrance and is a florist favorite.
                    It's easy to grow but can shed quite a bit, so it's best to pick up after them when you can.</p>

                <p>An ice plant may bloom from spring to winter depending on your area. A general rule is that it will
                    continue to bloom until the first frost. Though it's a moderate growing plant, it produces many
                    flowers. The flowers it produces are also exceptionally colorful and unique. It's called an ice
                    plant because it's foliage has small dots that resemble drops of clinging ice. It grows anywhere
                    from 6 - 8 inches high and comes in purple, yellow, and pink. It usually blooms with a mix of two of
                    these colors in a pattern that's eye-catching and distinctly its own.</p>

                <p>Better known as the holly plant, this winter favorite is well-known by many people as the Christmas
                    berry bush. It's prickly leaves and bright red berries are hard to miss. It's frequently used in
                    Christmas flower arrangements like table centerpieces and door wreathes. There are more than 400
                    species of holly plants, and though they look delectable, they should not be eaten. The berries can
                    upset the stomach of most who eat them, so keep them away from children and pets. Your holly bush
                    will usually start to grow in spring and begin to bloom berry stems in the fall. </p>

                <p>This cute and multi-flowering plant thrives in full shade. Though it doesn't require sunlight, it
                    produces many very colorful pastel flowers. Great for gardeners, patiens plants can reseed
                    themselves and are annual plants. The only trick to growing patiens plants is to make sure they
                    don't suffer from mildew. Since they grow best in shade where it's likely to be more moist, it's
                    best
                    to check them occasionally to make sure their soil isn't too moist/wet. Patiens flower types come in
                    pink, red, white, deep purple, light orange, lavender, and pale yellow.</p>

                <p>Nicknamed the star flower, ipheion uniflorum are shaped very similarly to stars. They have 6 petals
                    that are round and pointed at the end, and usually bloom in a pale white-blue color. The petals
                    bloom out and downwards in a unique shape. It's a low growing plant that's usually around 6 inches
                    tall and grows just 1/4 to 1/2 feet wide. They also come in white, but the pastel blue flowers are
                    more desired by most gardeners. It's grass like foliage is also pretty and for this reason it's
                    frequently used to line paths, walkways, and rock gardens.</p>

                <p>This sweet looking flower is also called a moonflower. It grows on a vine so you'll hear it most
                    frequently called a moonflower vine. It's deer tolerant and blooms fully in fall. Since it is a vine
                    plant, it requires some kind of structure to grow and may need some help or "direction suggestion".
                    It grows rapidly, so once it begins to elongate and bloom, be sure to check its placement once a day
                    or two. What's most alluring about the moonflower vine is that its flowers bloom at night, opening
                    to their full splendor under the moon. They will close before noon on the next day.</p>

                <p>Your morning glory plant's soil should be moist and well-drained until it's firmly established.
                    Afterwards you can just keep it well-drained with regular watering. The roots of morning glory
                    plants dislike being disturbed. If you plan on moving your morning glory plant, be prepared to take
                    your time and be very gentle with it. If you replant it from a pot to the ground, or from the ground
                    to a pot, try not to do it more than once. Morning glory plants that are healthy can grow up to 12
                    feet or more. They grow rapidly and expansively, so be sure when planted to give them plenty of
                    breathing room.</p>

                <p>It's hard to cover all forms of iris together as there are over 300 different species. In general
                    they grow to be around 28 - 30 inches high and have a 6 petal shape that's easily identified.
                    Sometimes called "bearded flowers", one petal droops attractively open, creating an eye-catching
                    shape that viewers love. They attract lovely butterflies and hummingbirds. They can also be
                    regularly cut which is partially why florists love using them in flower bouquets. Though they can
                    thrive in partial sun, it's still best to keep them in full sun when it's available.</p>

                <p>Known as corn lilies and also wand flowers, ixia grows best in very hot areas. Their stems are thin
                    and somewhat fragile, but despite that, they grow plentiful star shaped flowers. Ixia plants need
                    mulching and well-draining soil. Though they don't usually live past a year, they're not an
                    expensive bulb to purchase and they're available in most areas. They begin to bloom in late spring,
                    showing their full beauty in summer. Not only are different colors available, they also grow with
                    multi-colors. It's rare and unlikely to find an ixia plant flower in just one single color.</p>

                <p>Ixora is called both west indian jasmine, and flames of the woods. An ixora plant consists of mostly
                    greenery with sections of gathered petite red flowers resembling flame. It grows 3 - 5 feet high and
                    attracts bees and butterflies. The flowers form colorful clusters at the end of the stems. Most
                    frequently growing in shrub formations, they're excellent for lining paths and walkways. Depending
                    on the type of Ixora plant, yours could also resemble a small tree.</p>

                <p>Jaborosa plants can be more difficult to find and are not commonly grown; for good reason. Nicknamed
                    nightshade, if you see these plants or their blooming flowers, stay clear and away from them. Small
                    but lethal, these plants grow 6 - 12 inches tall and are mostly white or a light cream colored.
                    Nightshade is poisonous and can even kill people when ingested. Eating as little as three of this
                    plant's berries can kill someone. It's hard to find what zones are required to grow deadly
                    nightshade, because quite frankly no one should be growing it.</p>

                <p>This clump forming perennial is nicknamed Jacob's ladder for the way the flowers grow one on top of
                    another. There are many colors available in these bell shaped flowers from white, pink, and yellow,
                    but the richly decadent purple hue is one of the most desired. It's a lovely self-seeding plant that
                    will regrow with little care. You may also pick up the seeds and plant them later in a container or
                    pot. Both it's stems and foliage can be cut back as necessary to encourage new growth.</p>

                <p>Jasmine conjures up for many people the image of luxury perfumes before it does the actual flowers.
                    There are many types of jasmine that grow different colored and shaped petals, and most of them are
                    wonderfully fragrant. Strong and alluring, one vine of flourishing jasmine can fill an entire middle
                    to large sized room with rich fragrance. This shrub like plant most frequently comes in white and
                    pale pink, and grows up to 30 feet high! With a spread of 7 to 15 feet, when planting be sure to
                    give it plenty of space to stretch out.</p>

                <p>Native to western Australia, kangaroo paw plants grow tubular shaped flowers in fan like shapes.
                    You'll often find honeyeater birds around kangaroo paw flowers. The flowers deposit pollen on the
                    honeyeater birds who help carry the pollen elsewhere. It's a perennial plant that needs full sun and
                    can grow an impressive 2 - 10 feet tall. Though very tall, it usually grows just 1 - 2 feet wide. A
                    little bit different from your standard plant soil, it needs sandy and nutrient deficient soil to
                    thrive. Hence it needs nutrient deficient soil, no fertilizer is necessary to grow one.</p>

                <p>Knautia macedonica plants grow striking red-pink flowers in a star shaped cluster. They can bloom
                    from early summer until the end of fall and attract butterflies. They're deer resistant and easy to
                    care for. They grow as much as 2 - 3 feet high and wide, and can be cut frequently for bouquets. In
                    order for them to take bloom, we recommend that you start them out in containers at the beginning of
                    the spring season.</p>

                <p>Lavender is a favorite of florists, candle makers, apothecarys, and more. This amazing plant has
                    multiple benefits and is even used for cooking and making tea. You may plant it outside, but many
                    people like to keep them indoors too. Depending on the type of lavender plant you have, your flowers
                    may be white, pink, purple, or dark blue-purple. Different types of lavender are better for making
                    different things, so be sure to pick your plant based off of how you want to use it. If you don't
                    plan to use your lavender, you may still plant it and simply enjoy its strong and wonderful
                    fragrance. It's a calming smell, so use it to line your path home after a hard days work.</p>

                <p>Lechenaultia formosa plants are a perennial shrub that grows 12 - 18 inches high, and 12 - 15 inches
                    wide. Lechenaultia plants attract bees, birds, and butterflies to help pollinate your garden. Their
                    flower blooms are usually red with a hint of yellow at the center, and the shape is very distinct.
                    The petals turn out and then drastically downwards, with a front that almost looks like a lip. </p>

                <p>Another type of plant similar to the lechenaultia, is the blue biloba from the goodeniaceae family.
                    It's a shrub plant that grows 18 - 24 inches high with brilliantly bright blue flowers. They can
                    grow in different kinds of soil and also among rock gardens with fun to partial shade. Many people
                    love the lechenaultia bilba because its blue flower is a very distinct hue. It's said to be the

                <p>Also called lilac bush, these lovely and fragrant plants are often used for hedgings and pathways.
                    They do sometimes suffer from mildew so it's important to occasionally inspect them to make sure
                    that they're healthy. They need air circulation and full sun, so if you line your garden or home
                    with them, make sure they're on the side with the most sun exposure. Not a low maintenance plant,
                    lilac bushes also need regular pruning. It's important to thin them out so that they continue to
                    grow and receive the air circulation that they need to thrive. They come in several shades of light
                    and rich purple, pinks, and whites.</p>

                    forms into a thin stalk shape. The flowers look similar to petite snapdragons and though usually
                    purple, there are a few more colors available. </p>

                <p>Lisianthus is a herbaceous annual plant with white, purple, or pink flowers. It grows 6 - 40 inches
                    high and up to 14 inches wide during the spring season. It's also called prairie gentian, Texas
                    bluebell and eustoma lisianthus. This plant needs fast and highly draining soil, making it ideal for
                    raised beds and lifted pots with larger draining holes. While they tolerate heat fairly well, they
                    do not thrive well in rainy areas due to their sensitivity to overly wet soil.</p>

                <p>Not only do lobelia plants like being wet, they can tolerate flooding too. If you're planting in
                    dryer areas, adding mulch will help the plant maintain its moisture. It's also called cardinal
                    flower or lobelia cardinalis in areas of Missouri. It attracts butterflies, hummingbirds, and oddly

                <p>When riding a boat through muddy, murky waters, you may be very surprised to find one of the most
                    beautiful flowers you've ever seen. The lotus not only needs water, it's stems require it to be
                    completely submerged within a body of water. Perfect for a water garden or small pond, you can grow
                    a lotus plant to add a rich colorful flower to your water's surface. They make beautiful cut flowers
                    and permeate the air with a light and lovely fragrance. They're planted with a technique that uses a
                    draining pot, weights, and a lotus tuber root. They grow 3 - 8 feet high and 3 - 4 feet wide when
                    fully developed. Its genus name is nelumbo and it's probably the most famous water plant. Popular
                    varieties are miss jekyll, miss jekyll alba, persian jewels, blue midget, and cambridge blue. This
                    plant is toxic and should not be grown anywhere where children or animals might be tempted to ingest
                    it.</p>

                <p>Fossils have shown that magnolia plants existed at least 95 million years ago, and they're still
                    thriving today. There are many different types of magnolia plants. Some shrub varieties measure 15
                    feet wide while trees can grow up to 80 feet high or more. Most kinds bloom in early spring when
                    it's still slightly cool, and in some areas it may rebloom in summer and fall. While it will
                    tolerate partial sun, full sun is preferred. Magnolia trees also produce a cone shaped fruit that
                    attracts birds. The color of flowers your magnolia will grow will depend on the type you plant, but
                    many are pink, white, purple, and yellow. Magnolias are the earliest flowering plants that we've
                    discovered so far as a society, and they grew before bees even existed. Not only are they beautiful
                    in your garden, but you'll be able to share some flower history every time someone asks about them.

                <p>A full grown maltese cross plant can reach up to 3 feet high with a spread of 15 inches. It will
                    tolerate partial shade, but if grown in partial sunlight it will require occasional stalking. If you
                    plant multiple maltese cross plants, be sure to give them at least 6 inches of space in between.
                    They attract butterflies, hummingbirds, and are deer and rabbit resistant. They are good flowers for
                    cutting and are typically red or orange when in full bloom.</p>

                <p>Mandevilla plants grow large trumpet shaped flowers and dark-green leaves. This is a shrub and vine
                    growing style of plant. You can plant it in soil and give it a trellis to climb up(with some
                    encouragement), or you could also plant it in a hanging pot and let its beautiful floral vines hang
                    below for cascading look. Mandevilla plants do require pruning and can grow quickly. Prune it back
                    at
                    the end of fall, and don't be shy about pruning it to half its size. It's trumpeting flowers
                    flourish at the end of new branches, so this should create new and fresh flowers to grow. White and

                <p>There are at least 50 species of marigold plants, or tagetes plants. The golden marigold is one of
                    the most beautiful, usually growing in two colors of red and yellow. Marigolds are easy to care for,
                    and can be grown from seeds or seedlings. Marigold plants also produce an odor that works as a
                    mosquito repellent, due to their pyrethrum. They also repel a few other insect that you don't want
                    in your garden such as beetles and roundworms. Most types of marigolds are annuals, but they are
                    sensitive to frost, and should never be planted outdoors when there's still a chance of frost.</p>

                    tenweeks, hoary, and Brompton. Most frequently it's just called stock flower. Stock plants grow 1 -
                    3 feet high and need cool weather for setting. This plant is unique in that whether it's annual,
                    biennial, or perennial depends on where it grows. If in zones 7 - 10 it usually behaves as a
                    perennial, but in colder regions it grows annually. The location, soil, and temperature will change
                    how a stock plant grows. Typical colors are pink, lavender, white and yellow.</p>

                <p>Mayflower is also called trailing arbutus and grows usually 4 feet high and 3 - 4 feet wide.
                    Mayflowers are usually pink or white, and petite. There are both bush and tree types of Mayflower
                    plants. They attract butterflies and are deer resistant, but their main allure is their fragrance.
                    They got their nickname the mayflower, because in England they typically grow in the month of May.

                <p>Called the blue poppy for short, the rich pale blue color of the Himalayan poppy is truly unique
                    among flowers. Though Himalayan blue poppy plants aren't hard to care for, they need specific light
                    and soil to grow. They have a hard time growing in overly windy areas and hot areas. Blue poppies
                    need rich, well-draining soil and partial shade. They also need a manure, mulch, and organic
                    fertilizer mixture to grow. If you're looking for an easy to grow plant, blue poppy plants probably
                    aren't for you. If you're willing to take care of them, and ensure that they're properly planted,
                    you'll love the color payoff you'll get from it. </p>

                <p>The mimosa touch me not plant has a striking color, distinct shape and it also does part tricks. This
                    plant is famous for its unusually spiky flower, and its movement. When you touch the tip of the
                    flower, it actually moves and folds into itself. Once folded, they stay in their closed position for
                    a few minutes before unfolding again. Hence the fun nickname, "touch me not". They're also called
                    tickle me, sleeping plants, shy plants, and sensitive plants in some areas. This plant propagates
                    quickly, so if you grow it, keep it in a contained area in your garden. They also grow thorns very
                    near to the ground where you may be walking, so avoid placing them along pathways and always wear
                    shoes when tending to them. Tehy can be grown for seeds and can also be grown in containers. They're
                    perennials and can grow 30 - 40 centimeters high.</p>

                    yellow color and curved shape make it quickly recognizable. It's also called the Spanish flag flower
                    and sometimes firecracker vine. It's native to central and south America, though it now grows also
                    in Mexico and parts of Europe. Due to its uncontrolled rapid growth, its considered a weed. People
                    still choose to plant them though because they enjoy it's unique blooms. It's a hard plant to
                    control, so it's best to grow it in a pot when you can.</p>

                    It's a perennial plant and grows in a stock formation. This plant does not like to be moved once
                    it's taken root, so plant it with a plan of not moving it if at all possible. It's deer and rabbit

                <p>This sweet looking flower is also called a moonflower. It grows on a vine so you'll hear it most
                    frequently called a moonflower vine. It's deer tolerant and blooms fully in fall. Since it is a vine
                    plant, it requires some kind of structure to grow and may need some help or "direction suggestion".
                    It grows rapidly, so once it begins to elongate and bloom, be sure to check its placement once a day
                    or two. What's most alluring about the moonflower vine is that its flowers bloom at night, opening
                    to their full splendor under the moon. They will close before noon on the next day.</p>

                <p>Morning glory flowers, depending on area and soil, can grow in zones 3 - 10, though probably more
                    easily in 6 - 9. They're annual plants and climbers that can be encouraged to grow along archways,
                    trellises, and rails. A low maintenance plant, it doesn't need a lot of attention, just occasional
                    checks to make sure it's growing in the shape and direction you want. If it's having a hard time
                    maintaining moisture in your area, cover the soil with some mulch to help insulate wetness.</p>

                <p>Narcissus is more commonly just referred to as a white daffodil. Native to the southeastern
                    Mediterranean, narcissus plants like hot weather and dislike the cold. They are from the daffodil
                    family, and called narcissus tazetta. They can come in yellow, orange, and white, but if you're
                    specifically referring to paperwhites, it's usually the white bloom. They can grow in pots, the
                    ground, or carefully crafted bowls of water with rocks.</p>

                <p>Nasturtium plants can grow from summer to fall in cool places, but they also grow from fall to summer
                    in milder areas too. Popular types of nasturtium plants are Alaska, jewel, peach melba, and the
                    canary creeper species. Most types are annuals but some are perennials. Since they can grow spring -
                    fall or winter - spring, when you plant them varies by your location and the area's temperature.</p>

                <p>Nemesia is sometimes mistaken as an orchid, with four petals in a fan shape, one larger than the
                    rest. This plant grows plentiful amounts of flowers, so much in fact that sometimes you can't see
                    the greenery below. They can be grown in your garden, pots, and also hanging baskets. They usually
                    grow a foot tall, but can sometimes reach two feet high also. In most areas you'll easily find pink,
                    purple, white and blue nemesia flowers to choose from. A nemesia plant won't survive frost, so be
                    sure to plant after there's no risk of frost, and if your plant is potter or hanging, bring it
                    inside
                    if you suspect a frost is coming. They need very little care, especially if they're hanging, except
                    for the occasional watering.</p>

                <p>Nemophila plants are an annual plant type and are native to California. Their bright blue color is
                    hard to miss, and very showy. They grow anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 foot high only, and spread to about
                    the same width; 1/2 to 1 foot wide. Its genus comes from the words nemos and phileo, meaning wooden
                    glade or wooden pasture, and love. When planted in the ideal conditions, baby blue eyes will self
                    seed. Do not plant them in overly hot and humid climates as they are susceptible to mildew and
                    aphids.</p>

                <p>Native to Europe, Africa and Asia, there are many different hybrids of nepeta plants. Also called
                    catmint, they can grow in partial shade but prefer full sunlight. You can use division to create
                    more plants in the spring, dividing them to cover more area. Catmint plants contain nepetalactone,
                    which cats love because they cause a temporary moment of euphoria.</p>

                <p>Nicotiana plants are native to southern Brazil, northern Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Colombia.
                    Anicotiana plant can suffer from too much sun, getting sun scorch and drying out. They still enjoy
                    full sun, but they need a few hours of shade too, but not every day. This is why many gardeners
                    plant them using mulch to help lock in moisture, so that they don't have to tend to them as
                    frequently. All forms of tobacco include toxins, nicotine, anabasine, and many other alkaloids.
                    Listed as a class 1 toxic plant, to posinous to both pets, wild animals, and humans too.</p>

                <p>Also called cup flower, or cupflowers by some, this annual plant has a simple but very pretty soft
                    flower. It will behave as an annual flower when planted in its ideal conditions. Be sure to deadhead
                    any passing blooms to encourage it to continue growing. To help it retain moisture, you can use a
                    bit of mulch. It needs moist soil, but it also loves heat. The flowers that bloom are usually white,
                    blue, or mixed. To propagate them you can use stem cuttings or the seeds. Nierembergia plants are
                    wonderfully low maintenance, attract lovely birds and are great for planting inside of containers
                    too.</p>

                <p>There are many types of lilies, but stargazer lilies are a favorite around the world. They have a
                    bright and quickly recognized red and white color, bedecked with attractive speckles. Stargazers,
                    and stargazer lilies in particular, need plenty of direct sunlight to thrive. Stargazer plants are
                    always what's called a heavy feeder, meaning that they need a generous amount of fertilizer and
                    water. Most flowers from the lily family are slightly toxic and should be kept away from cats. Just
                    to be safe, we would recommend that you also keep them away from dogs and small children.</p>

                <p>Some poppies are annuals, biennials, and perennials. Mature plants grow from 3 - 4 feet high and 1 -
                    2 feet wide. Oriental poppies are a beautiful flower that doesn't bloom very long. In some areas
                    they only bloom 1 - 3 days! Gardeners will plant different kinds of poppies in the same area so that
                    flowers will bloom at different times. Popular types of poppy plants are called black and white,
                    Goliath, John III, Mrs. Perry, watermellon and Von Zeppelin poppies. You can also plant them amongst
                    daffodils and tulips, which won't interfere with your oriental poppy plant.</p>

                <p>Beautifully green and tinged with rich purple, the oyster plant has small flowers at its base and is
                    a beautiful addition to any garden. It's usually 1 1/2 feet tall and easily planted and maintained.
                    The leaves have a mesmerizing three color, ombre affect that's hard to miss. If they're potted and
                    kept indoors they will need full sunlight. If they're planted outdoors then partial sunlight is

                <p>Ox eye daisies usually begin blooming in spring with flowers spanning 1 - 3 inches wide. You can tell
                    them apart from other daisy-like flowers by looking for their slightly notched petals. If you
                    deadhead them, they will continue to produce flowers into the summer. Other nicknames for them are
                    marguerite, field daisy, moon daisy, dog daisy, moon penny, and many more. It's deer resistant and
                    attracts healthy pollinators to your garden. Be warned before planting them, some people consider
                    them a weed. They not only grow easily and rapidly but can cross vast areas of land. Be careful when
                    planting them and be ever mindful or keeping them contained somewhere away from your other plant

                <p>One of many gardener's favorite flowers, in many locations the pansy flower can be planted in fall
                    and continue to grow throughout winter and well into spring. Though they won't look particularly
                    robust during the winter, they'll still bloom, reaching their fullest potential in spring. Pansies
                    are a hybrid form of viola x wittrockiana, which has many different species. Both pansy and viola
                    flowers are hardy but short-lived perennials that can be used as annuals and biennials, under the
                    right circumstances. So why might you plant pansies instead of violas? Pansy flowering plants offer
                    a much wider range or colors and they can be planted amongst other kinds of flowers, and in some
                    cases right on top of other flowers, growing at different times of the season. Full sun is better
                    for a pansy plant, but in partial sun it should still be able to survive.</p>

                <p>Pelargonium plants grow best inf ull sun, but in particularly hot climates theyc an benefit from
                    partial shade. Also called angel eyes and geraniums, they're grown more for the full, dark green
                    foliage they create than for their flowers. The flowers are usually various hues of pink, white, or
                    mixtures of the two. Their dried leaves are used for creating candles, fragrance, and potpourris.
                    The small fruit grows in the shape of a beak, and that's why the pelargonium name comes from the
                    Latin word pelargos; meaning stork.</p>

                    you choose, will grow 8 - 20 inches wide. These plants are good for cut flowers and can easily be
                    kept in planters. They can grow all season depending on where and how they're planted.</p>

                <p>If you plant peonies and don't see them blooming, don't be alarmed. They sometimes take 3 years to
                    bloom. Peony flowers need lots of sunlight but may not benefit from constant indirect sunlight.
                    Plant them somewhere where they'll receive 6 - 8 hours or indirect or partial sunlight for the best
                    results. They also need space in the soil to spread out and seek nutrients. Peony plants require
                    rich soil and need plentiful nutrients, so don't plant them next to other plants that will compete
                    with them for nutrients. Depending on your growing area they may also grow better with rich, organic
                    fertilizer.</p>

                <p>Grow persian buttercup flowers in full sun unless your climate is very hot, in which case they'll
                    benefit from partial sun. Their soil is a bit unique and needs a bit of sand and extremely
                    well-draining soil. Be sure when you plant them that the frost is finished for the season as persian
                    buttercups can not withstand even a light frost. Give them only a little water until they begin to
                    bloom, then they may have more water but do not allow them to become moist. Air on the side of dryer

                <p>Peruvian lilies are beautiful and often featured in florist flower bouquets. They aren't very
                    expensive to grow and care for, growing easily and offering plentiful amounts of blooms per plant.
                    they're available in numerous colors from red, yellow, pink, orange, green, purple, and white. They
                    may need some fertilizer, but just a little at the start of spring. They can be planted in pots and
                    brought inside if you want them to grow longer. Be sure to care for them by cutting back green
                    growth and removing any fallen dead flowers. Peruvian lily flowers are excellent cut flowers and
                    look lovely in flower bouquets as an accompanying flower, or by themselves.</p>

                <p>There are about 35 species of nightshade, or solanaceae. The petunia is one of the safe varieties
                    that forms a trumpet shaped flower in a bright color. The flowers have 5 petals, but the petals are
                    attached to form a continuous funnel shape all around. They can bloom from spring or summer well
                    into fall, depending on the area and climate. They're usually classified as a perennial plant but in
                    some cases can behave as an annual plant too. Gardeners do plant them, but you'll find them most
                    often in window boxes at window sills. There are numerous colors to choose from but pinks and
                    purples are usually favored.</p>

                <p>This plant is also called summer phlox, due to its love of full sun. Phlox flowering plants grow 3 -
                    4 feet high with large clusters of petite flowers. Phlox needs space to breath and air circulation.
                    They can survive full sun and hot climates, but in hotter areas will need more space to ensure they
                    get proper circulation. They usually grow better with a small amount of fertilizer and you should
                    clip flower stems that have fading flowers to ensure new growth. </p>

                <p>There are many flowers in your garden to attract wildlife, insects and pollinators, but few flowers
                    attract as many butterflies as pincushion flowers. Pincushion flowers are easy to plant and require
                    very little care. They form wiry stems and wave slightly in the breeze attracting every butterfly in
                    the area. One healthy plant can create up to 20 - 50 blooms. They'll usually grow until frost comes
                    and they respond well to deadheading. Popular types of pincushions, or scaboisa flowers, are black
                    knight, butterfly blue, fama white, kompliment, and pink mist.</p>

                <p>Also called pink ladys slipper orchid, this plant is moderately difficult to grow and should be
                    avoided by beginner gardeners. It's native to the woodlands in Eastern North America. Some gardeners
                    argue that it's better described as a zones 3 - 8 plant. These plants grow large flowers that form a
                    rounded egg shape that's distinctly theirs, about 2 - 3 inches tall. Though insects visit them to
                    pollinate them, they should find that there's no nectar inside the flower. It's a very short growing
                    flowering plant and blooms anywhere from 1 - 2 months. They usually require mulch, can not be
                    over-watered, and are also sensitive to mineral buildup. They are not a low maintenance plant.</p>

                <p>Plume celosia or cockscomb is a unique flower that's easily recognized. It has a triangle shaped
                    floral top with an almost fuzzy flower. Plume celosia likes to be planted in direct sunlight while a
                    seed, but once it begins to sprout, benefits from partial sun or partial shaded areas. Once they
                    begin flowering they can last anywhere from 6 - 8 weeks. The flower has the funny nickname cockscomb
                    because its unusual flower shape resembles the head of a rooster.</p>

                    frequently given as gifts during November and December. They grow to about 2 feet tall and are a
                    perennial shrub. They can be yellow, white, pink or red, red being by far the most popular. It's

                    lilies of the field" also refers to the poppy. There are many kinds of poppy anemones available and
                    they come in double, single, and semi-double versions. They can be cut flowers, but cut them from
                    the ruff of the plant, nearer the bottom. Once they're bloomed, keep them out of strong direct
                    light, it may wilt your flowers. They're deer resistant and can be planted on hills, in rockbeds,

                <p>Known as woodland flowers, the true primrose or primula, is a vividly bright flower that comes in
                    many different colors. They're a fragrant flower that attracts pollinators like bees and
                    butterflies. Their foliage is pretty but can be different depending on your plant. Some leaves are
                    jagged, fuzzy, wide, thin, you may have two of the same plant with different leaves. They can
                    survive in full shade, but partial shade is preferred. Since there are many different sizes of
                    primrose plants, depending on yours, it may grow from 6 - 3 inches high and 8 - 20 wide. A primrose
                    or primula plant is perfect for filling in any shady areas of your garden that you still want to
                    have color.</p>

                <p>Quaker lady flowers are more commonly called bluets due to their richly blue color. They're a
                    wildflower that grows 3 - 8 inches high and likes acidic soil. You may see them growing organically
                    in parts of England and frequently in the state of Texas in the US. Bluets plants are perennials and
                    their flowers have an interesting 4 petal shape with a lighter colored center. Though they prefer
                    full or partial sun, as a wildflower and almost weed, they can also grow in partial or full shade in
                    some areas. They are hardy and easy to care for, but make sure they are contained when you plant
                    them. It's important to control their growth.</p>

                <p>Queen Anne's Lace is a good flower for cutting and also re-seeds itself. It attracts pollinators like
                    bees, birds, and butterflies and needs minimal care. Also called Daucus carota, though it's lovely,
                    be very careful planting it in your garden. Queen Anne’s lace plants grow quickly, freely, and in a
                    plentiful manner. Try to plant them some distance from your garden and always check that they are
                    contained. The plant gets its nickname from Queen Anne of England, whom is said to have pricked her
                    finger while tatting homemade lace, which results in flecks of blood on the finished design. Queen
                    Anne’s lace plants usually grow 24 - 36 inches high and 9 - 12 inches wide at least.</p>

                    Toyo-Noshiki, and Texas Scarlet. People like them because they don't just produce beautiful flowers,
                    they also grow small fruits that birds enjoy. They're mostly native to China and Korea, and are
                    considered a shrub plant. They can grow 6 - 10 feet high and just as wide in the proper conditions.
                    Popular color choices are red, pink, white and orange. They usually benefit from regular watering
                    and occasionally mulch, depending on your area and the climate. They're a drought tolerant plant,
                    but need more care while growing. Prune them quickly when they first bloom to encourage new growth

                <p>Grow persian buttercup flowers in full sun unless your climate is very hot, in which case they'll
                    benefit from partial sun. Their soil is a bit unique and needs a bit of sand and extremely
                    well-draining soil. Be sure when you plant them that the frost is finished for the season as persian
                    buttercups can not withstand even a light frost. Give them only a little water until they begin to
                    bloom, then they may have more water but do not allow them to become moist. Air on the side of dryer

                <p>Rondeletia plants are shrub plants native to North and South America. They come from the Rubiaceae
                    family which is one of the largest flower families containing an abundance of different species,
                    styles, and colors. Though there are more than 150 species, many of the flowers are somewhat similar
                    with 4 - 5 petals, growing in a cluster at the ends of stems. Depending on the breed of rondeletia
                    you plant and your area, it may bloom in spring, Summer or even Winter. Rondeletia flowers usually
                    have yellow centers and come in shades of white, red, pink, and yellow.</p>

                <p>The exact zone needed for roses can change by the type you by. In general they need at least 6 hours
                    of sun and well-draining soil. Most types of roses will benefit from mulch cover and regular
                    pruning. Insects do like roses, so be sure to check them regularly for bug problems. Though they
                    love sun, the hottest part of the afternoon can be hard on roses. You may want to plant them in
                    partial sun if your area has very hot summer days.</p>

                <p>Rudbeckia flowering plants can be annual, biennial, or short lived depending on the kind you choose
                    and how they're planted. They attract songbirds, butterflies, bees and more helpful insects and
                    pollinators. They're sometimes called black-eyed susans and commonly come in colors orange, yellow,
                    brown, bronze and burgundy. They have interestingly scratchy and hairy leaves which helps to
                    identify them quickly. They're sometimes confused with daisies but their petals bloom downwards,
                    their center is larger, and their leaves are different.</p>

                <p>Saponaria plants grow 4 - 5 inches tall and 15 - 18 wide, so they're a shorter plant that's nice for
                    walkways and flower beds. They attract bees and butterflies and are also deer resistant. A low
                    maintenance plant, they can be ground outdoors or in containers too. This flower is easy to grow, so
                    if you're a beginning gardener you should consider it. It's often used as groundcover because it
                    grows easily and can help fill in unattractive parts of a yard where there are dirt or brown
                    patches.</p>

                <p>There are many flowers in your garden to attract wildlife, insects and pollinators, but few flowers
                    attract as many butterflies as pincushion flowers. Pincushion flowers are easy to plant and require
                    very little care. They form wiry stems and wave slightly in the breeze attracting every butterfly in
                    the area. One healthy plant can create up to 20 - 50 blooms. They'll usually grow until frost comes
                    and they respond well to deadheading. Popular types of pincushions, or scaboisa flowers, are black
                    knight, butterfly blue, fama white, kompliment, and pink mist.</p>

                <p>Pelargonium plants grow best inf ull sun, but in particularly hot climates theyc an benefit from
                    partial shade. Also called angel eyes and geraniums, they're grown more for the full, dark green
                    foliage they create than for their flowers. The flowers are usually various hues of pink, white, or
                    mixtures of the two. Their dried leaves are used for creating candles, fragrance, and potpourris.
                    The small fruit grows in the shape of a beak, and that's why the pelargonium name comes from the
                    Latin word pelargos; meaning stork.</p>

                <p>Not a fussy plant, scilla flowering plants will grow in most areas whether full sun or partially
                    shaded. As long as the soil drains well and they receive regular water, they should flourish in most
                    locations. Note when planting scilla bulbs, they do have a clear top and bottom. How you place them
                    in the soil matters. The pointed end should face upwards. If you plant one incorrectly it should
                    still grow, but it's best to plant them in the correct position for the best results.</p>

                <p>Snowdrop plants are also called Galanthus nivalis, and as the name implies, their beautiful flowers
                    look very much like drops of snow. A short ground flower, it only grows 3 - 6 inches high with one
                    flower hanging per stalk/stem in the shape of snow. Once the snowdrop flower is in full bloom, three
                    petals spread open to reveal three more on the inside. Snowdrop plants are perennials that can
                    naturalize and spread, though not always quickly. To propagate snowdrop plants you can divid the
                    bulbs.</p>

                <p>Goldrod plants are from the aster family and there are over 120 known species. Many people consider
                    them almost a weed because of their quick ability to grow and rapidly cover land. They aren't
                    deterred by many environments and can grow in wet marshy, hilly, rocky, forest and meadow areas.
                    Growing 2 to 6 feet high with a brilliant yellow hue, they're easy to spot and are frequently found
                    in North and South America. These deer resistant plants also have few diseases and insects problems,
                    though some people are allergic to them.</p>

                <p>A happy, large, and structured flower, sunflowers are loved around the world. A sunflower plant can
                    grow up to 8 feet tall! It's one of the most popular perennial flowering plants and usually will
                    come back year after year. They attract butterflies, hummingbirds, and other insects to help
                    pollinate your garden space. If you prefer smaller flowers, there are many different species to
                    choose from. They make excellent cut flowers and are a florist favorite for adding to birthday
                    bouquets and summer bouquets. Most flowers come in shades of yellow but red ones exist too.</p>

                <p>Fairly easy to care for and brightly colorful, many gardeners like sweet pea plants. You may choose
                    from blue, purple, pink, white, red, and yellow varieties. You can cut sweet peas to make beautiful
                    bouquets at home and to decorate inside your home. Though small they give off a sweet and light
                    scent that most people adore. They're a slow germinating plant, so that's the only trick to growing
                    them. Once they've taken root and begin to grow, they require very little care and attention other
                    than occasional watering and removing dead flowers.</p>

                <p>Also called lilac, these lovely and fragrant plants are often used for hedgings and pathways. They do
                    sometimes suffer from mildew so it's important to occasionally inspect them to make sure that
                    they're healthy. They need air circulation and full sun, so if you line your garden or home with
                    them, make sure they're on the side with the most sun exposure. Not a low maintenance plant, lilac
                    bushes also need regular pruning. It's important to thin them out so that they continue to grow and
                    receive the air circulation that they need to thrive. They come in several shades of light and rich
                    purple, pinks, and whites.</p>

                <p>Marigold plants don't grow as tall as other varieties, but their color payoff is very impressive.
                    They grow anywhere from 6 to 30 inches high and are often bright shades of orange, yellow, and
                    orange-yellow mixes. They're often mistaken for carnations because they do look similar. Their
                    petals are plentiful, brightly colored, and have ruffled edges. </p>

                <p>Hybrid tea roses are a deciduous shrub that can grow 3 - 8 feet tall and 2 - 3 feet wide. They bloom
                    a fairly long time from spring into fall, or the first frost. Tea roses, and most roses in general,
                    need a bit of mulching to thrive. The type of tea rose you plant should depend mainly on the kind of
                    organic soil you have in your garden. Some tea roses need more iron, others more acidity, test your
                    soil and then pick what works best in your area. They enjoy full sun, but if your area is very hot,
                    be sure to give them some relief from the hottest afternoon light.</p>

                <p>How to exactly care for and treat your tiger lily plant will depend on the exact type that you plant.
                    Lilium lancifolium, lilium colombianum, lilium parvum, and lilium michauxii are popular plants and
                    they each need some care. Unlike other flowers that can tolerate shade, this flowering tiger lily
                    plant needs an abundance of sunlight almost every day to survive. Some tiger lilies need stalking
                    once they start to bloom because their flowers are so grandiose. This is partly why gardeners are so
                    attracted to them. Adding large amounts of color to any garden, the tiger lily plant is beautiful
                    and can even be a focal point of your layout if you wish. The main trick to growing tiger lily
                    plants successfully, is giving them full sun every day, while keeping their soil moist.</p>

                <p>The tithonia plant is also called a Mexican sunflower or Japanese sunflower, and nitobe
                    chrysanthemum. It begins to bloom in summer and will continue to bloom until the first frost in your
                    area. Tithonia plants attract bees and butterflies to your garden and also add rich color to
                    wherever they're planted. These flowers are so pigmented that they almost look neon when they bloom.
                    Typically they are bright orange, red, or yellow. Sometimes they're mistaken for an orange daisy or
                    gerbera daisy, but they're larger and their centers are shaped and colored differently.</p>

                <p>Trillium is a beautifully woodland plant that blooms in late winter and spring, usually with
                    beautiful 3 petal, white flowers. It's 3 petals have also earned it the nickname trinity flower,

                    species of trilliums of different colors that also grow in different regions. If you're thinking of
                    planting trillium, consider these popular favorites: prairie trillium, great white trillium, yellow
                    trillium and yankee woodlanders. Though you can cut trillium flowers, it's probably better not to,
                    and always avoid cutting the leaves which will result in damage to the plant.</p>

                <p>Triteleia plants need rich, nutrient dense, well-draining soil. Native to western North America,
                    there are over 15 species of triteleia. Triteleia plants are usually used for garden borders and can
                    grow around woody and rocky areas too. Their flowers are striking, usually a pale blue or purple,
                    with darker colored streaks running from the center to the tips or the flower petals. One plant can
                    grow 1 - 2 feet high and 3/4 to 1 1/2 feet wide. They're a low maintenance plant with rich color
                    that grows best in loamy or sometimes sandy soils. They're from the asparagaceae family.</p>

                <p>This winter blooming geophyte plant has cup shaped, concave flowers that are small and brightly
                    colored. They need a sunny area to grow and well ventilated air. They can grow in zones 3 - 10, or
                    as perennials in zones 7 - 10. Trotnia grows 4 - 24 inches tall and most gardeners use it as an
                    annual plant. Also called blazing star and flame freesia, you'd think it always has red flowers, but
                    there are also yellow, brown, orange, white and pink varieties. They carry a light but lovely
                    fragrance that's nice in most gardens and doesn't conflict with other floral scents. </p>

                <p>Trollius plants come from the ranunculaceae family and are considered wildflowers. These wildflower
                    perennial plants like growing near ponds, in damp woody areas, and in moist gardens. They're more
                    commonly known as globeflowers because of their globe like shape. They grow in circular orbs with
                    inward curved petals, just like a ball. Be patient if you plant seeds as they can sometimes take up
                    to two years to germinate properly. They aren't an overly picky plant and will grow usually in
                    partial or full sun. It's just important to keep their ground moist wherever you plant them.</p>

                <p>Tropaeolum plants can grow anywhere from 1 - 10 feet high and 1 - 3 feet wide. Though they do bloom
                    in spring, you're more likely to see their full potential in fall. The lovely annual growing flower
                    lures in pretty butterflies and is also deer tolerant. It comes in red, ornage, yellow, rarely cream
                    and sometimes a mixture of those colors. Whats truly alluring about them is their spicy fragrance.
                    Although it looks like a basic flower at first, in fact very similar to a morning glory, it's color
                    is very bold and it's spicy smell is almost startling. The way the plant grows is very versatile,
                    especially depending on the type that you choose. It can be used to decorate walls, rocky areas,
                    borders, flower beds, or just a slopping hill.</p>

                <p>The trumpet vine plant is a fast growing perennial that's famous for easily attracting hummingbirds.
                    When looking at the trumpet vine, it's easy to see why hummingbirds like it. Due to it's tubular
                    trumpet shaped flower, the hummingbird is one of the few animals that can easily get to its center.
                    Trumpet flowering plants are not difficult to grow. They grow well in many different soil types and
                    can live in both partial and full sun. Though it grows well in many places and different landscapes,
                    it can suffer from overcrowding. Be sure to give it plenty of space to grow, spread out, and don't
                    plant it too close to your home, boulders, or trees. If it's overcrowded not only will your plant
                    suffer, but your house and pluming could to. This creeping vine can sometimes have a mind of its
                    own.</p>

                <p>Tuberose also goes by the name snapdragon, dog's mouth, lion's mouth and toad's mouth. It comes in
                    many different color varieties such as white, yellow, red, orange, pink, purple, peach and shades of
                    dark violet. Tuberose, or snapdragon flowers, grow straight up in a stalk formation of petite
                    flowers. They're render perennials that are fairly area specific. They grow best in zones 8 or 9 and
                    in general prefer milder climates. If you'd like to encourage new growth, your tuberose plant will
                    benefit from regular deadheading. You'll probably want to cut these flowers are enjoy them inside
                    anyways each year. They're picky about their moist soil, but be sure to water them regularly to keep
                    their growing area moist.</p>

                <p>Depending on the type of tulip you plant, your flowers may like zones 4 - 6 or zones 7 - 8. Tulips
                    form an almost cone shaped flower, Once in full bloom, they push their petals outward and usually
                    perish soon after. They're a spring blooming flower that needs cool weather beforehand to "set"
                    properly. Tulips are a much beloved flower, but they don't bloom a very long time. Be sure when
                    planting your tulips to also give them protection from wind. These flowers are heavier than they
                    look, and though their stem in thick, it's not overly strong. In mild to strong wind, they're likely
                    to bend and break. Mice, squirrels, and deer also like to eat them. Though perennial tulips can be
                    quite a lot to deal with as a gardener, people really love them and continue to grow them.</p>

                    blooms, it reveals a very structured flower in pink, red, and lavender. It grows 24 - 36 inches high
                    and about 36 - 48 inches wide. It's a bromeliad plant native to the tropics and has been cultivated
                    for gardeners. They make look difficult to grow, but they're low maintenance plants. It's more
                    important that they're grown in areas where they can flourish. Zones 8 - 11 are best since they were

                <p>This annual plant grows a medium sized bright orange flower that looks similar to a daisy. They're a

                    cutting, just don't overcut them, as they don't produce a vast amount of flowers per plant. For a
                    fuller plant, stick with the Ursinia anthemoides, also known as the solar fire flowering plant. It
                    grows up to 15 inches tall and though it's not very wide, it produces an abundance of flowers. It's
                    excellent for cutting.</p>

                <p>Uva ursi isa herbaceous perennial from the Ericaceae family. It's a low maintenance plant that only
                    grows 1/2 to 1 foot tall, but can spread up to 6 feet wide. Because of the way it grows, low and
                    outwards, it's mainly used for ground coverage. These plants will tolerate shade, though full sun
                    exposure is better. It's also called bearberry, kinninnick, and bear berry. Depending on the kind
                    you grow and what stage of growth it's in, your bearberry plant could have berry like blooms, or
                    small, dangling flowers. Many people plant bearberry plants in areas where their garden soil is
                    prone to erosion. This plant is tolerant of erosion and can not only withstand it, but usually keep
                    those areas looking more healthy, neat, and tidy.</p>

                <p>There are more than 150 species of viburnum to choose from, and different kinds will need slightly
                    different flower zones. Some grow beautiful flowers, some are short, some tall, and others growsmall
                    berries or fruits. They're native to North American and also grow naturally in Southeast Asia and
                    parts of South America. Flowering viburnum plants usually bloom throughout spring, whereas berry and
                    fruit versions will bloom more so in summer and fall. Your viburnum plants could be low growing,
                    shrub, or tree like plants. Decide where in your garden you'd like to plant a viburnum plant, and
                    it's very likely you'll find a variety that grows well in those conditions.</p>

                <p>There are more than 30 varieties of periwinkle, and it's a popular flower for beginning and
                    experienced gardeners. Periwinkles are one of the few types of flowers that grow well in shade. If
                    you'd like to add a small pop of color to a dark spot of your garden, a periwinkle plant may be
                    perfect for you. Periwinkle plants aren't very tall, but they can spread to almost 8 feet wide.
                    They're perfect for ground coverage, but keep in mind that they grow vastly and with little care.
                    Make sure wherever they're planted, that they won't interfere with the rest of your garden, and give
                    them plenty of breathing space. The fastest way to spot a periwinkle, is by its height(or lack
                    thereof) and it's spinning, twisted style petals.</p>

                <p>There are many different types but viola wittrockiana, but they're most commonly just called pansies.
                    They're mostly short lived perennial plants, but some can be planted as biennials. How your plant
                    grows will be greatly determined by what time of the year it's planted, and your area's climate.
                    Viola wittrockiana usually refers to the darker purple colored pansies, however they are red, blue,
                    purple, yellow, pink, peach and even bicolored pansy plants. These low growing flowers are very
                    pretty and make great walkways, paths, and look beautifully growing in a windowsill. They're deer
                    resistant and also attract lovely butterflies to your garden.</p>

                <p>Viola plants can be both annual or perennial, depending on the type and when you plant it. Viola
                    Viola Tri-Colour plants usually grow to about 8 inches tall and 8 inches wide. They're a hermaphrodite
                    flower so they're self fertile. It's not a picky plant and can usually survive in full or partial
                    sun, and can also survive in shade. It's best known as the tri color violet because it's color and
                    shape are striking, it's usually lavender, yellow, and chartuese; but you'll find many slightly
                    different mixes. </p>

                <p>Sometimes referred to as whisker flowers, these cute flowers have a face shaped bloom. There are more
                    than 500 species of this rugged perennial that can also behave as an annual plant. Flexible and
                    tolerant, violet plants can grow in mild cool and warm climates. Depending on the area and type you
                    plant, they may bloom in winter, spring, or fall. They're a good flower for cutting, can be grown in
                    pots and containers, and have a pleasant fragrance too. There are various colors to choose from like
                    red, purple, blue, orange, pink, yellow, and white. Some have a mix of colors once in full bloom.
                    They grow usually 6 - 12 inches high but typically only 6 inches wide. If you want to use them as
                    groundcover in your garden, you'll need to plant quite a few of them.</p>

                <p>Virginia creeper plants are a deciduous perennial vine, so they don't grow very high, but they cover
                    a vast area of land. Though they may be excellent in that they're low maintenance and great for
                    landscaping, they can grow vastly out of control. Be very careful before planting one that it's in
                    an area where you can keep it contained. You don't want your virginia creeper plant to take over
                    your garden, or do damage to your home's foundation.</p>

                    mixed variation of two of those hues. Nymphaea does take some planning to grow. It must be grown in
                    a pot or container that can be weighted down under still water. It needs to be planted 5-6 inches
                    below the water, but as it grows you'll have to keep it in position, moving the pot further
                    downwards as your waterlily grows. Nymphaea plant, to water lily plants, are truly beautiful; but
                    they're not low maintenance. If you plant one be sure to read extensively on its care and growing
                    best practices.

                <p>From the iridaceae family, the bugle lily is a medium sized flower that forms into the shape of a
                    long tube. Best grown as an annual flowering plant, watsonia is native to South Africa and needs
                    lots of full sun exposure to mature. The flowers are very noticeable, measuring around 2 1/2 inches
                    long. The bugle lily plant grows 3 - 5 feet high and can spread anywhere from 2 - 3 feet wide. If
                    and when you decide to plant one, be sure to give it room to grow in both directions.</p>

                <p>This interesting hoya carnosa plant is called wax flower because it grows a stiff circular flower
                    that looks almost like it's coated in wax. There are over 100 species of hoya that you could plant
                    depending on your area and climate needs. Be prepared to wait for some hoya plants to bloom. Some
                    types of hoya could take 5 - 7 years before their flowers bloom. Hoya plants due to their slow
                    growing nature, perform best when they aren't moved. It's best to move your hoya plant as little as
                    possible. Your plant will need to be thoroughly saturated with water, but not often. Give it a good
                    soaking when the soil begins to feel overly dry, but do not overwater it. </p>

                <p>A bit of an unusual plant, wedelia plants can flourish in full or partial sun and also full or
                    partial shade. Wedelia plants need very little care to grow and are wonderfully low maintenance.
                    When it comes to planting wedelia you need to place it somewhere where you can keep it in check. The
                    plant grows easily and rapidly, and if not watched, it can sometimes overrun your garden. Plant it
                    slightly away from your garden and try to keep it somewhere where it won't overspread. It's most
                    frequently used as ground cover. Many people spot a wedelia flower and think that it is a sunflower,
                    but it is a different species.</p>

                    equally wide. Weigela shrubs benefit from 6 - 8 hours of direct sunlight, but they can also survive
                    in partial sun. Give your weigela plant plenty of space to mature, up to 4 feet on either side and
                    out of the way of any foundations like pathways or your home. Weigela plants can be planted in
                    direct soil or in pots too. They can be susceptible to black spot so just check them occasionally to
                    make sure they're healthy.</p>

                <p>These lovely gaura plants are called whirling butterflies due to their 4 petal flower structure that
                    also tilts to the side. The flower itself looks as though a spinning bloom was frozen mid turn, with
                    a light center of draping stems. The species gaura lindheimeri is usually just referred to as agura
                    and is a perennial type of plant. Not surprisingly, this plant attracts butterflies, along with
                    hummingbirds. This plant is also heat, humidity, and drought tolerant, so it's easy to care for.</p>

                <p>There at least 2830 species of rosaceae that you plant in your garden. Before planting you'll want to
                    look up the exact species of rose that you want, and to read about it's specific needs. In general
                    many roses will need at least partial sunlight and regular light watering, but that can change by
                    the species you pick and your geographic location. Some types of roses are more fragrant than
                    others, and many have vastly different medicinal qualities. How much sun your rose plant needs will
                    vary by how hot your summers are. If you have mild heat, than your roses can be grown in direct full
                    sunlight. If your summers are intensely hot, it's best to plant them in partial sun because they'll
                    need shade during the hottest part of the day. Roses are excellent flowers for cutting, and cutting
                    them can encourage new growth and longer plant life.</p>

                <p>Wild violets are a lovely flower that begins blooming in spring and lasts through summer with
                    beautiful color and soft petals. Wild violets grow 1/2 to 3/4 feet high and equally as wide.
                    Attracting butterflies and other wildlife to your garden, this herbaceous perennial is a great
                    addition to your garden. The flowers that bloom from a wild violet plant are usually white or
                    various shades of blue. Wild violets are a great plant option for beginning gardeners too because
                    they're not overly picky with their planting and growing needs. In mild climates they can grow in
                    full and partial sun or shade. They also self-seed so you can enjoy them continuously if nothing
                    happens to entirely kill the plant.</p>

                <p>Windflowers are more commonly known in the flower world as poppy anemone plants, or poppy anemones.
                    Their flowers have the typically poppy shaped bloom that gentle folds upwards and curls in on
                    itself, with a rich and dark center. The plants grow 12 - 15 inches tall and the flowers can grow
                    anywhere from 2 - 3 inches across. Depending on the type of windflower or poppy anemone that you
                    choose, your soil needs will vary. Some poppy plants prefer clay, sandy, or loamy soils. There are
                    different colors to choose from but the blue and rich dark purple poppy flowers are the most
                    requested, though they can be hard to find locally. </p>

                <p>Native to Southern France and Bulgaria, this short growing but pretty flowering plant is a great
                    garden addition. It's called winter aconite because it's an early spring blooming flower. If you're
                    looking to fill a flower bed or to use them as ground cover, you'll need to plant quite a few of
                    them. One winter aconite plant will usually grow 1/4 to 1/2 foot high and spread just as much.
                    Winter aconite isn't a difficult plant to grow and isn't very demanding. It can grow in full or
                    partial sun and also partial shade. It's only major drawback is that it needs year around watering.
                    It's also not a good plant to move around, it likes to be settled in one spot permanently.</p>

                <p>Winterberry, holly, and red berry are all popular names for ilex verticillata plants. The name is
                    obvious and winterberry is a berry or shrub like berry plant that can continue to grow in winter.
                    Sometimes it will bloom from spring to winter, winter to spring, or spring through winter and into
                    spring again. A lot of how your plant behaves will depend on your area and how intense or mild your
                    winters are. This slow growing shrub is usually 3 - 12 inches tall once fully mature with bright red
                    berries the measure .25 inches across.</p>

                <p>It's also called the welcoming spring flower, because winter jasmine is one of the first plants to

                <p>Wisteria is a beautiful shrub plant usually with draping clusters of blue, white or purple flowers.
                    It mostly blooms in spring but will sometimes continue to flower into summer too. It's a vining
                    plant that can grow 25 - 30 feet long once it's fully mature. Wisteria flowers have a rich fragrance
                    that's pleasant and strong. Since its vines are strong, it's recommended that you not plant it too
                    close to your home or any important structures around your home. </p>

                <p>These plants can grow in full sun but prefer partially shaded to fully shaded areas. They seed
                    themselves and grow freely, requiring little care or guidance. They usually grow 4 - 6 inches high
                    and 6 - 8 inches across. Most plants flourish better with well-drained soil, but since the woolly
                    violet is used to woody and shaded areas, it can sit a bit in moist soil. This plant also has unique
                    greenery, with leaves that twist and curl into themselves in a unique shape. Woolly violet plants
                    are good for adding a pop of color to shady areas of your garden. Blue and purple flowers are
                    popular choices of woolly plants, but you may find other hues in your local area. Though a shorter
                    and smaller plant, they do have a pleasant fragrance once in full bloom.</p>

                <p>Xeranthemum comes from the asteraceae family and grows on average about 12 - 18 inches high. They're
                    mostly grown as annuals and are relatively easy to care for. They typically benefit from regular
                    watering, so long as you don't overwater them, and long periods of sun exposure. Blooming in the
                    middle of summer and sometimes into fall, they produce and light pink or white flower that looks
                    slightly similar to a daisy but with more jagged petal tips. This plant is a self-sow variety and
                    will continue to rebloom during the season each year if properly cared for.</p>

                <p>Also called bear grass and turkey beard, this herb perennial plant blooms in spring and summer with
                    what looks like a fuzzy head. It's grows an impressive 2 - 5 feet tall and requires very little
                    care. The flowers that grow on Xerophyllum can be used to create clothing, medicines, and other
                    woven objects. The flowers grow together to form a cluster on top of white or cream colored blooms.
                    It does take a few years for Xerophyllum plants to grow, so be patient while waiting for them to
                    produce greenery or flowers. If you live in a dry area, you can use mulch to help your plant
                    maintain moisture.</p>

                <p>Yellow archangel plants typically feature a yellow flower, which is partially why they have the name
                    that they do. They're excellent for planting in shaded areas of your garden, needing little sun to
                    grow and thrive, and they flowers have a light fragrance. A yellow archangel plant can be invasive,
                    so it's best to plant them in a contained area away from your home when possible. It comes from the
                    mint family, and when you crunch its leaves, you can smell its minty fragrance. It's leaves are also
                    very distinct, looking almost as if painted, with white patterns on top of the green leaf.</p>

                <p>This annual plant from the asteraceae family is native to Mexico and has a lovely flower. A mature
                    zinnia plant grows 1 - 4 feet high and 3/4 - 1 foot wide. It's flower colors vary and can be red,
                    orange, pink, yellow, purple, green, pale pink, and white. It's an ideal flower bloom for attracting
                    much needed pollinators to your garden like birds, hummingbirds, and butterflies. You can sow the
                    seed into the ground once the frost is finished. These plants are relatively easy to care for, but
                    air circulation is important. Be sure to plant them somewhere where the air moves and they get
                    sufficient light, so that they'll continue to bloom.</p>
